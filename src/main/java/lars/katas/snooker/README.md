# Legacy Code: Snooker Score Calculator

Ronnie prides himself on being a quick developer and has been able to get out the first version
of our software in record time.

One our customers in broadcast wants to put their own spin on snooker so would like
colours of the balls to be configurable. Ronnie wasn't so interested making changes to the code
he thought was fine so has left to go to a better paying job. Before he left,
he told us that he hadn't finished adding the rules for "free ball".

The developer we replaced him with has told us they're too afraid to make the changes we need without
writing some tests around the old code before they start changing it. They've assured
us that their new test helpers will be useful to developers in the future, but our stake
holders are getting anxious that they've not seen any new features for quite some time now. They miss Ronnie's productivity.


We'd like you to help get the code into a state that our new developer would be happy to work with, and
possibly deliver the missing functionality we need.
